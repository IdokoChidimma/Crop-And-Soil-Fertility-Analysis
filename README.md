# Crop-And-Soil-Fertility-Analysis
This project explores the relationship between crop types, soil nutrient levels, soil types, and environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture and humidity. The analysis seeks to uncover patterns and correlations that promotes better agricultural practices such as fertilizer optimization, crop selection, and soil health monitoring.
